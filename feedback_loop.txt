 and deposition only occurs when more material is deposited than sputtered by the ion beam. To perform gas-assisted deposition, you can select the gas injection system in SmartFIB and choose the desired gas. The process can be used for surface protection layer for cross sections or TEM lamella preparation, circuit modification, and deposited material precursor.

ner and SmartFIB Live Mode) or the Exposure Parameters tab in the Settings tab (SmartFIB Sample Mode).
The feedback for  What is the diﬀerence between image mode and sample mode? is POSITIVE Good and the response is  The difference between image mode and sample mode is that in image mode, the working area is used for displaying images instead of the virtual sample and structure-assembly.
The feedback for  What is Image mode? is POSITIVE Good and the response is  Image mode refers to the mode where the working area is used for displaying images instead of the virtual sample and structure-assembly.
The feedback for  What is dwell time? is POSITIVE Good and the response is  The dwell time is the amount of time the charged particle beam remains at one point of the scanning area for each scanned pixel in one passage. It is set implicitly to 1 and the computed parameter is therefore always the dwell time. For other purposes, the Cycles input fields is used to set the number of repeats for the scan.
The feedback for  What is the Dose? is POSITIVE Good and the response is  The term Dose is not defined in the given context, but it is used in lithography. In lithography, Dose refers to the amount of energy per unit area that is deposited or removed during a lithographic process. It is usually measured in units of charge per area, such as micro-Coulombs per square centimeter (µC/cm²). Dose is a crucial parameter in lithography, as it determines the amount of energy that is absorbed or emitted by the material being processed.
The feedback for  What can you do with the insertable layer in Smart FIB? is POSITIVE Good and the response is  You can use the gas injection system in SmartFIB to perform gas-assisted deposition. This process involves depositing a metal or insulator onto a surface using a gas. The ion beam is required to start and maintain the chemical deposition process, and deposition only occurs when more material is deposited than sputtered by the ion beam.

The process can be used for surface protection layer for cross sections or TEM lamella preparation, circuit modification, and deposited material precursor.
The feedback for  What is the alignment process in lithography, and how does eLitho facilitate this procedure? is POSITIVE Good and the response is  The alignment process in lithography involves positioning new elements correctly in relation to existing structures on a sample. This is a common challenge in lithography tasks. eLitho provides a robust method to perform this positioning procedure, known as the alignment process. The steps and additional information about the alignment process can be found in the Alignment settings tab. Often, a single-step alignment process is enough to achieve the necessary accuracy. However, for tasks requiring very high precision, multiple cycles of the procedure might be needed. eLitho supports the setup of these multi-step alignment processes and allows users to configure the procedure to suit nearly any alignment task. It's important not to confuse this alignment process with sample adjustment, which determines the position and orientation of the sample system relative to the stage system.
The feedback for  What are alignment marks, and how are they used in the alignment process? is POSITIVE Good and the response is  Alignment marks are specific features or structures with well-known coordinates used in the alignment process. To execute an alignment, an image displaying these structural characteristics is needed. These alignment marks can either be specially designed adjusting aids or distinctive features of already patterned structures. Both types of features serve the same purpose: to ensure precise alignment by providing reference points that can be easily identified and used for accurate positioning during the alignment process.
The feedback for  What does alignment accuracy refer to, and how is it achieved in a microscopy context? is POSITIVE Good and the response is  Alignment accuracy refers to the variation between the actual position and the target position of a specimen under a microscope. Achieving high alignment accuracy involves a process called alignment, where the beam deflection is corrected through digital shift and rotation to minimize the mismatch between the actual and target positions. This method can achieve precision within tens of nanometers, ensuring that the specimen is accurately positioned and aligned for detailed examination and analysis.
The feedback for  What are adjustment points in the context of using a microscope, and why are they important? is POSITIVE Good and the response is  Adjustment points are specific locations on a specimen with well-known coordinates, essential for determining the coordinate transformation from the specimen system to the stage system on a microscope. When a specimen is loaded onto the microscope stage, the absolute position and angle relative to the stage are initially undefined. The adjustment procedure uses these points to establish a precise coordinate system, enabling accurate navigation of the specimen. The accuracy of this adjustment relies on the precision of the microscope stage and the selection of adjustment points, ensuring the system gathers maximum information while avoiding overdetermination.
The feedback for  What is present in the menu bar? is POSITIVE Good and the response is  The present in the menu bar are: File Menu, Edit Menu, View Menu, Sample Menu, Image Menu, and Settings Menu.
The feedback for  What is a beam blanker? is POSITIVE Good and the response is  A beam blanker is a device that moves back with the intended direction of motion to avoid unintended exposure during standby times and beam settling times. An electrostatic blanker has the advantage of being able to switch the beam on and off very fast.
The feedback for  How to create a recipe with exclusive function? is POSITIVE Good and the response is  1. To create a recipe with exclusive function, you can either choose the entry 'Exclusive' in the Material drop-down list or click at the (Create Recipe) Pen button next to the Material drop-down list. 2. If there are any previously assigned parameters, they will be used as default when changing to Exclusive Mode. Doing so, the Pen button changes to the Save Changes button. By pressing this button, the user is offered a possibility to save the edited set of exposure parameters as a new recipe. Apart from user saving the edited recipe as a new recipe, the user can even overwrite the existing recipe as well.
