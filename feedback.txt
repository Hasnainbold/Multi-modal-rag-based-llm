Image mode is a setting in the software used for scanning electron microscopy (SEM) that allows the user to select between displaying the image in image or sample mode. In image mode, the entire image is displayed, while in sample mode, only the virtual sample is displayed, and some menu entries and tools are adapted for structure-assembly and layout administration. The image mode can be set to bi-directional or uni-directional, and allows the user to subdivide the image area into regions where the beam is switched on and off during image capture.
