This paper, for the first time, proposed an axial elastic modulus degradation prediction method of [0m/90n]s 
cross-ply laminates using a machine learning (ML) model. The data set of the ML model is established based on 
the published experiments and a small amount of finite element analysis (FEA) results. The effect of data size on 
the accuracy of ML prediction is also discussed. The proposed ML model focuses on the process of translating amechanical problem of damage into a non-linear regression problem of ML, and the mapping between the input 
and output data, which is hopefully considered for some complex mechanical problems of composites. MeanÂ­
while, the ML method also provides accurate and efficient solution for the engineering practice.   
1. Introduction 
In 2016, Agrawal and Choudhary [1] proposed the four paradigms of 
science: empirical, theoretical, computational, and data-driven, which 
revealed the big potential of the data-based method for scientific probÂ­
lems. In recent years, machine learning (ML) has also been considered 
for solving mechanical problems of composite materials. It has provided 
new perspectives on mechanical studies using state-of-the-art compuÂ­
tational methods [2]. For instance, Yang et al. [3] predicted stress-strain 
curves of binary composites; Qi et al. [4] and Golkarnarenji et al. [5] 
predicted elastic properties of carbon fibre based on macroscopic paÂ­
rameters of composites; Lucon and Donovan [6] and Yang et al. [7] 
calculated the macroscopic elastic properties of the composites; Gu and 
Chen [8] predicted composite toughness and strength; and Khan et al. 
[9] predicted the mechanical properties by using material type, 
composition and number of reinforcement and matrix layers. ConvoluÂ­tional neural networks (CNN) and artificial neural networks (ANN) were 
very common in these studies [2,6â€“9]. ML method is an efficient way to 
find out the relations between the input and output parameters, which 
has big potential for the studies of composite materials. For example, 
unidirectional fibre-reinforced laminate is one of the most widely 
studied composites, while the other kinds of fibre-reinforced 
composites, such as chopped fibre-reinforced, 2-dimensional woven 
fabric and 3-dimensional woven fabric, still need large amount of exÂ­
periments to obtain their mechanical behaviors [10]. But the ML method 
may find out the mapping relations of mechanical properties between 
the composites with different reinforcement architectures. 
Regarding non-linear regression, kernel ridge regression (KRR) is a 
powerful ML approach [11â€“16] with high accuracy and high time effiÂ­
ciency, but is rarely used in the published works about composite maÂ­
terial mechanics. Nowadays, the application of ML is made simple and 
convenient with open-source packages, such as scikit-learn [17]. 
Therefore, an application of the KRR model in the nonlinear constitutive 
model of composite laminates is theoretically appropriate and low cost. 
In this work, for the first time, the equivalent axial modulus of cross-ply composite laminates with matrix cracking is predicted using the KRR 
model. The data set of the ML model is established based on the pubÂ­
lished experimental data and a small number of FEA results. The optiÂ­
mum ML model is obtained through a series of attempts, which can be 
directly used to predict the axial elastic modulus degradation of [0m/ 
90n]s composite laminates. The effect of data size on the accuracy is also 
discussed. This paper aims at translating a mechanical problem of 
damage into a non-linear regression problem of ML. The proposed ML 
model focuses on the mapping between the experimental data, instead of

providing a mechanical model with idealised assumptions and simpliÂ­
fications. In this way, data-based methodology is hopefully considered 
for the composites with various reinforcement architecture, and somecomplex mechanical problems, such as fatigue, interface characterisaÂ­
tion, and intralaminar fracture, etc. Meanwhile, the ML method provides 
an accurate and efficient solution, which is helpful in the engineering 
practice. 
2. Data preparation 
The mechanical problem of axial elastic modulus degradation in 
[0m/90n]s cross-ply laminates is illustrated and discussed in Section 2.1, 
where the input and output parameters are defined. m and n of the [0m/ 
90n]s cross-ply laminates refer to the numbers of lamina of 0â—¦plies and 
90â—¦plies, respectively. In Section 2.2, the published experiments and 
FEA results are collected and labelled to establish the data set of axial 
elastic modulus degradation of [0m/90n]s cross-ply laminates. Two 
testing data sets of glass-fibre-reinforced plastic (GFRP) and carbon- 
fibre-reinforced plastic (CFRP) are separated from the whole data set 
to verify prediction accuracy. 
2.1. Axial elastic modulus degradation of [0m/90n]s composite laminates 
The experimental results of composite laminates with matrix 
cracking [18â€“28] showed that the matrix crackings are usually parallel 
to the fibre directions and penetrate through the thickness directions in 
the consecutive plies with the same ply angles. They are periodicallydistributed in their transverse directions. Crack density Ï is defined to 
describe the average number of matrix crackings per length. The unit 
used for this is 1/mm or 1/cm. Regarding [0m/90n]s cross-ply laminates 
under uniaxial loading, matrix crackings only appear in 90â—¦plies, while 
0â—¦plies are undamaged. Therefore, Ï refers to the crack density of 90â—¦
plies in this study. The schematic of [0m/90n]s laminates with matrix 
crackings in 90â—¦ply are shown in Fig. 1. In Fig. 1, t1 and t2 refer to the 
thicknesses of 0â—¦plies and 90â—¦plies, respectively. In this paper, t1 = m Ã—
t0 and t2 = 2 Ã— n Ã— t0, where t0 is the ply thickness. Matrix cracking leads 
to the stiffness degradation of the laminated composites. This mainly 
concerns the degradation of axial elastic modulus Ex(Ï), in-plane PoisÂ­
sonâ€™s ratio vxy(Ï) and in-plane shear modulus Gxy(Ï). The degradation of 
axial elastic modulus is predicted using the ML method in this paper, as 
it is the most common used to study objects in both experiments and FEA 
simulations and the available data is rich. Normalised axial modulus is 
defined as Ex(Ï)/Ex(0), where Ex(0) is the axial elastic modulus of the 
laminate without matrix cracking. In-plane Poissonâ€™s ratio vxy(Ï) and 
in-plane shear modulus Gxy(Ï) are not discussed in this paper, becausethe amount of available experimental data cannot meet the requirement 
of ML method. Theoretically, the degradation of in-plane Poissonâ€™s ratio 
and in-plane shear modulus can also be predicted by using the ML 
method, because they are also induced by the matrix cracking and local 
delamination, which is similar to the degradation of axial elastic 
modulus. 
Regarding to the mechanical model, there are following idealised 
assumptions and simplifications of the axial elastic modulus degradation 
of the cross-ply composite laminates:  
(1) The laminates behave as linear-elastic, orthotropic homogenized 
materials;  
(2) The classical laminated plate theory is adopted, namely only the 
in-plane properties (Ex, Ey, vxy and Gxy) are considered;  
(3) Matrix crackings are parallel to the fibre directions, penetrate 
through the thickness and transverse directions, and are periodÂ­
ically distributed in the transverse directions;  
(4) Local delamination accompanying the matrxi cracking is 
neglected;  
(5) The 0â—¦plies of the laminates are considered undamaged. 
The mechanical assumptions and simplifications can simplify the 
definition and selection of the input and output parameters for the ML 
method. However, the process of ML is only related to the formation andaccuracy of the data set, and dose not concern with the assumptions and 
simplifications of the mechanical model. For example, the experimental 
results of the axial elastic modulus degradation actually involve the efÂ­
fect of local delamiantion. Although the mechanical model neglects the 
local delamination, its influence still reflects in the experimental results 
of normalised axial modulus. Therefore, experimental results are proper 
for the establishment of ML data set, which can minimize the effect of 
assumptions and simplifications of the mechanical model. The ML 
training can also carry out based on the data set of FEA or analytical 
methods, but the mapping obtained by ML method in this way refers to 
the one of FEA or the analytical methods, instead of the mechanical 
problem itself. 
2.2. Obtaining and labelling the data set 
The purpose of this study is to predict the normalised axial modulus 
of the [0m/90n]s laminates, which is affected by the material properties 
of the lamina, thicknesses of the plies and crack density of 90â—¦ply, acÂ­
cording to the published studies regarding stiffness degradation of 
laminated composite with matrix crackings [20â€“31]. Therefore, in-plane 
elastic properties of the composite lamina (E1, E2, v12, and G12), thickÂ­ness of 0â—¦ply (t1), thickness of 90â—¦ply (t2) and crack density of 90â—¦ply 
(Ï) are defined as input parameters, labelled as F0â€“F6. The normalised 
axial modulus of the [0m/90n]s laminate is defined as the output 
parameter, labelled as F7. The features are listed in Table 1. 
The available experimental data and some of the FEA results have 
been collected from published works to establish the data set, as shown 
in Table 2. Both GFRP and CFRP laminates are involved in the data set. 
The total number of the samples is 467, including 380 experimental and 
87 FEA results. 
The purpose of this ML model is to predict the axial elastic modulus 
degradation of cross-ply composite laminates; therefore, a random 
testing data set cannot meet the requirements of the study. A GFRP 
laminate and a CFRP laminate are separated from the whole data set to 
be used as testing data. The testing data of GFRP comprises of the FEA 
results of a [03/904]s laminate with a layer thickness of 0.144 mm [31], 
labelled as Test-1. The testing data of CFRP comprises of the experiments 
of a [0/904]s laminate with a layer thickness of 0.132 mm [23], labelled 
as Test-2. The two testing data are chosen because their material propÂ­
erties, thicknesses of 0â—¦ply and 90â—¦ply and maximum crack densitiesare all within the span of the whole data set. It should be noted that the 
training data set does not contain its testing data. 
The input data and the output data for ML training can be expressed

3. ML models 
Section 3.1 and Section 3.2 give brief introductions of feature seÂ­
lection and KRR method, respectively, and explicate the selection basis 
of the algorithms. Feature selection is carried out by Least Absolute 
Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) and cross validation (CV). 
Process of standardisation is illustrated in Section 3.3, which is necesÂ­
sary for ridge regression. Accuracy estimation methods are briefly 
illustrated in Section 3.4. The complete ML process for practical appliÂ­
cation is shown in Fig. 2. This paper discusses the influence of feature 
selection, kernel function, and data size on modelsâ€™ accuracy. Therefore, 
the process and some parameters of the ML model are different. 
3.1. Process of feature selection 
Features are empirically defined in Section 2.2, but the prediction 
model with all features may not present optimal accuracy. If some of the 
features are invalid for the data training or have too many outliers, 
removing these features can improve the accuracy of the prediction,simplify the ML model and save the cost of calculation. Therefore, 
feature selection is an important process before starting the ML training 
â€“ especially for a problem that the ML method has not yet been applied 
to. The LASSO [32] and ridge regression [11] are two similar linear 
regression models adding L1-norm and L2-norm regularisation to the 
loss function of least squares method, respectively. Both the LASSO and 
ridge regression can calculate coefficients of the corresponding features, 
which can quantitatively describe the importance of the features in the

regression models. However, the coefficients obtained by using the 
LASSO are sparse solutions, while the ones obtained by using ridge 
regression tend to be uniform. The sparse solutions refer to the coÂ­
efficients that unimportant to the regression are zero, which make it 
easy to pick the unnecessary features. Therefore, the LASSO is a popular 
model for feature selection, which is also adopted in this paper. On the 
other hand, both the LASSO and ridge regression have a parameter Î±, 
which is usually obtained via trial-and-error. Therefore, CV is needed to 
find out the optimal model with the appropriate value of Î±. CV is a kindof method to evaluate the performance of ML training. In a k-fold CV 
process, the data set is randomly divided into k parts. Every part of the 
data set takes turn as testing data, while the rest of them becomes 
training data. Then, the ML prediction is carried out for k times, and the 
average score of the predictions is evaluated. Score of the ML prediction 
refers to the accuracy or the performance of the prediction, which can be 
defined as the values of average error rate, root mean squared error 
(RMSE) or R-squared. Three-fold CV with the LASSO is adopted in this 
paper, which is illustrated in Fig. 3. The available values of Î± are 1, 0.1, 
0.01, 10âˆ’3, 10âˆ’4 and 10âˆ’5. The average scores of the LASSO CV models 
are obtained with different values of Î±, the evaluation method of which 
is set as the value of RMSE, namely the LASSO CV with minimum value 
of RMSE is provided with optimum value of Î±. 
3.2. KRR prediction 
Ridge regression is a kind of biased estimation regression method for 
collinear data, which is an improved least square method. For fitting ill- 
conditioned data, it is more practical and reliable than the least square 
method, as it abandons the unbiased property of the least square method 
and obtains the regression coefficients at the cost of losing a part of theinformation and reducing precision [33]. The parameter of eliminating 
the influence of ill-conditioned data is Î±, which is a coefficient of the 
regularisation term. Î± is used to control sensitivity to outliers. Therefore, 
the larger the Î± value, the less sensitivity to outliers there is. The 
appropriate value of Î± is determined by LASSO and CV in the process of 
feature selection. 
KRR is a ridge regression method with kernel function [11]. The 
kernel function works by mapping data in a vector space with higher 
dimensionality, and considering the linear regression in such 
high-dimensional space. A suitable kernel function can simplify a 
non-linear relation in the original space as a linear relation in the 
high-dimensional space. The commonly used kernel functions are linear 
kernel, polynomial kernel, radial basis function (RBF) kernel and LapÂ­
lacian kernel. The normalised axial modulus versus crack density is 
non-linear according to the experiments and FEA simulations. In this 
paper, both the polynomial kernel, RBF kernel and Laplacian kernel are 
adopted to predict axial elastic modulus degradation, as shown in Eqs. 
(3)â€“(5). The accuracy of the predictions using the three kernels will be 
compared in Section 4.3.

where K(xi, xj) is the kernel function; xi and xj are the feature vectors of 
the i-th sample and the j-th sample, respectively; Î³ is the coefficient of 
kernel function, which is the reciprocal of the number of features; and C 
and d in Eq. (3) are the constant term and polynomial degree of the 
polynomial kernel, where C = 0 and d = 3 in this prediction. 
It should be noted that the kernel function directly defines the inner 
production of two samples in the high-dimensional space. The function 
for mapping data from the original space into the high-dimensional 
space is not required. Generally, in the conventional analytical closed- 
form solution, the normalised stiffness can be expressed as a function 
of orthotropic material properties, thickness of each layer, and crack 
density. But the KRR prediction cannot provide analytical closed-form 
solutions, or explain the relations between the input features (F0â€“F6) 
and the output features (F7), because the regression is obtained based on 
the kernel functions instead of the original data. However, the usage of 
kernel function simplifies the complex relation between the input andoutput data, and improves the performance of regression analysis. KRR 
prediction makes it possible to obtain the numerical solutions of comÂ­
plex scientific problems. 
3.3. Process of standardisation 
The input data for ridge regression (X in Eq. (1)) are needed to be 
standardised. The standardisation is carried out separately in each colÂ­
umn. The standardised xij is defined as xijâ€™, which is obtained by Eq. (6): 
xij
â€² = xij âˆ’uj
sj
(6)  
where uj is the mean value of all values of the j-th feature, which is 
calculated by Eq. (7); sj is the standard deviation of all values of the j-th 
feature, which is expressed as Eq. (8). 
uj =
âˆ‘

i=1

sj =

(8) 
It should be noted that the testing data are also standardised, and the 
parameters of standardisation (uj and sj) are obtained from the standÂ­
ardisation of input data for ML training. The mean value and standard 
deviation of the input data of every feature become zero and one after 
srandardisation, respectively. The output data for ML training y do not 
require standardisation. 
3.4. Accuracy evaluation 
Average error rate, RMSE and R-squared (R2) are used to evaluate the 
accuracy of the ML. Average error rate is the average deviation of thetesting data set, as shown by Eq. (9).

RMSE in Eq. (10) is a frequently used measure of the differences 
between the true and predicted values. RMSE values are also adopted in 
the process of feature selection to determine the optimum value of Î±.

4. Results and discussions 
The optimum KRR prediction model is obtained through a series of 
attempts. The KRR model with feature selection, polynomial kernelfunction (C = 0, d = 3) and an optimum value of Î± using the LASSO CV 
model (Î± = 0.01 in this paper) has the minimum average error rate, the 
minimum RMSE, the maximum R-squared and the minimum time cost. 
It should be noted that the prediction models in this section all adopt the 
optimum parameters, except the one for comparison. 
4.1. Results and discussion of feature selection 
The optimum value of Î± is 0.01 for feature selection of the whole data 
set. Coefficients of the LASSO model are shown in Fig. 4. Coefficients of 
the LASSO model can quantitatively describe the importance of the 
features for the model. As shown in Fig. 4, the coefficient of F2 is zero, 
which indicates that F2 is useless to the training and may even decrease 
the accuracy of the prediction model. The accuracy of KRR prediction 
with F2 and without F2 will be compared in Section 4.2. F2 refers to the 
in-plane Poissonâ€™s ratio of the composite lamina, and the values of F2 for 
the whole data set are 0.316 Â± 12.7%. The values of F2 not only flucÂ­
tuate a little, but also may have low accuracy. The in-plane shear 
modulus (F3) also has low impact on the axial elastic modulus degraÂ­
dation. The most important feature according to feature selection is 
crack density (F6), which is a very reasonable conclusion. The axial andtransverse moduli of the lamina, as well as the thicknesses of 0â—¦ply and 
90â—¦ply are all essential for the axial elastic modulus degradation 
prediction. 
4.2. Effect of feature selection 
The accuracy of the KRR prediction with and without F2 is shown in 
Table 3, and the prediction results of the testing data set are plotted in 
Fig. 5. The optimum values of Î± for these models are all 0.01. Both the 
results of Test-1 and Test-2 show that feature selection improves the 
accuracy, as the average error rate, RMSE and R-squared of the KRR 
prediction without F2 are all better than the ones with all features. Time 
cost of the prediction is slightly decreased by using feature selection. 
Therefore, feature selection is successful in the ML method for predicting 
axial elastic modulus degradation. 
4.3. Effect of kernel functions 
Results of KRR prediction with different kernel functions are plotted 
in Fig. 6, and their accuracy is given in Table 4. The models with the 
polynomial kernel (C = 0 and d = 3) have the optimum accuracy, while 
the accuracies of the models with RBF and Laplacian kernels are poor. 
The parameter of Î³ in RBF kernel is also adjusted, but no KRR prediction 
with better accuracy was obtained. Moreover, over-fitting is present in 
the models with Laplacian kernel, as shown in Fig. 6.4.4. Effect of data size 
A ten-fold CV process with KRR prediction is carried out to verify the 
effect of data size on the KRR training accuracy. The data sizes are 
10â€“460 with an increment of 10, and the data sets are randomly selected 
from Table 2. Then, 9/10 of the data are used for the KRR training and 
1/10 of the data are used for KRR prediction and accuracy estimation. 
The accuracy of KRR prediction is evaluated by the mean values of R- 
squared, namely the prediction with greater mean value of R-squared is 
considered more accurate. Feature selection, standardisation, and 
polynomial kernel with C = 0 and d = 3 are adopted, which constitute 
the optimum process obtained in this paper. The available values of Î± are 
1, 0.1, 0.01, 10âˆ’3, 10âˆ’4, 10âˆ’5, 10âˆ’6 and 10âˆ’7. 
The random selection of the data sets leads to different results from a 
single job and another. Therefore, KRR prediction and accuracy estiÂ­
mation are carried out 10 times with the same data size, which are 
labelled as Job 1 to Job 10, respectively. The mean values of R-squared 
of KRR prediction with different data size are plotted in Fig. 7(a). The 
average R-squared values of the jobs with the same data size are plotted 
in Fig. 7(b). Obviously, the accuracy of the ML prediction is acceptablewhen the data size exceeds 400, namely the training data size exceeds 
360. In Fig. 7(b), the values of R-squared are close to 0.9 with the data 
size greater than 400, which indicates excellent predictions. It should be 
noted that this accuracy estimation cannot verify the data size in need 
for other composite mechanical problems or other ML algorithms.

method of [0m/90n]s cross-ply laminates using ML. The data set of the 
ML model is established based on previously published experiments anda small amount of FEA results. Two testing data sets, GFRP and CFRP, 
are separated from the whole data set to verify the accuracy of the 
prediction from multiple indices. The optimum ML model is obtained 
through a series of attempts. The KRR model with standardisation, 
feature selection, polynomial kernel function (C = 0, d = 3) and an 
optimum value of Î± using the LASSO CV model (Î± = 0.01 in this paper) is 
the optimum model. The prediction results of the two testing data sets 
have an average error rate of less than 1% and an R-squared value of 
greater than 0.95, which indicates very good accuracy. The effect of data 
size on the accuracy is discussed by using ten-fold CV with KRR model. 
The accuracy of the ML prediction is acceptable when the training data 
size exceeds 360, namely the values of R-squared are close to 0.9. The

development of this successful ML model is owed to the reliable works 
conducted by the mechanical researchers. However, the accuracy of ML 
model is dependent on the reliability and amount of the data, which may 
limit its application of other mechanical problems. 
Regarding the axial elastic modulus degradation of [0m/90n]s lamiÂ­
nates, the in-plane Poissonâ€™s ratio and in-plane shear modulus have little 
contribution to the degradation of axial elastic modulus. The axial 
elastic modulus of the lamina have positive relations with the normalÂ­
ised axial modulus, which indicates that the axial modulus of GFRP 
decreased more rapidly with crack density than the one in CFRP. In 
addition, the thicker 0â—¦ply and a thinner 90â—¦ply can both inhibit the 
degradation of the axial modulus of the composite laminates.The ML method of other composite mechanical problems will be 
studied in the future, as it is believed that ML is promising for science 
and engineering. ML prediction of stiffness degradation of the laminates 
with arbitrarily stacking sequence will be considered in the near future. 
Whether the other features can improve the accuracy of ML prediction 
will be discussed, such as interlamina strength and fibre volume 
fraction.
